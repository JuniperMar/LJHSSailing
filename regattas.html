      <p>SoCal Regattas are regional regattas that don't count to our overall rankings. They are great practice with local competition! PCISA 10%ers are larger regattas, each with a specific name. The scores from these regattas count to our team's rankings and will qualify us for the Silver or Gold Pacific Coast Championships. Learn more about following the scores <a class="link" href="./information#trackingResults">here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="date">September 14, 2024</h3>
            <p class="description">As the first high school PCISA regatta of the year, this was the first time the freshmen on the team raced against other high school teams. It was also the first time racing for a couple sailors! Light wind throughout the day and moored boats to dodge. This was a very very rough day of racing... we did absolutely horrendously... guess everyone has to start somewhere.</p>

            <p class="description">As the name suggests, we saw sea otters. While sailing and from ashore, one could also spot lots of sea lions, cormorants, gulls, and other wildlife! We sailed gold for our first big PCISA regatta which was a mistake: we did pretty badly. Still lots of fun though! Starts!!!</p>

            <p class="description">Beach launches from Rosie's Dog Beach got everyone soaked during roations. Three high school fleets (Gold, Silver, and Bronze), along with a college fleet culminated in a big regatta with lots of sailors! Again, there was light wind. After the first day of racing, the team enjoyed a talk about collegiate sailing.</p>

            <p class="description">For a change in the weather, we had gusty winds and rain! Toward the end of the second day, the stormy weather subsided and we had sunny skies once again. Overall, it was a very fun weekend of sailing! The last race brought smiles all around for LJHS sailing because we finally did better than the back of the fleet, we got third!</p>

            <p class="description">Despite the light wind, LJHS sailing sailed through the fleet to obtain a fourth place finish by the end of the event. Launched in first during their very first B Division race, the shackle on Malia and Katie's forestay broke on the downwind leading to the jib falling down and the mast starting to come down. With no more unlucky boat mishaps for the rest of the weekend, we enjoyed sailing in Oakland!</p>

            <p class="description">With very light winds the first day, there was worry that a complete regatta wouldn't be possible. Nevertheless, we were grateful to have good wind picking up on Sunday and a day full of racing! After an eventful weekend with wind from 2-15+ knots, LJHS secured a fifth place finish!</p>

            <p class="description">With a light breeze that picked up a bit around mid-day, SoCal #5 was filled with lots of fun sailing! On the second day, there was a fire nearby that brought contaminated air to the race course area. Besides this, the weekend was sunny skies! Due to the current, there were lots of general recalls. We finished the first day in third place and got fifth place in the end!</p>
