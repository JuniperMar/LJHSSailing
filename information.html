        <h3 class="bottomMargin">Coach Josh's Notes</h3>
        <p class="bottomMargin">Hello team I am sharing some videos on boat handling. The first video is pretty much gold standard for crew work. Unfortunately it does not have a wing on wing gybe. When you look through the videos try to pay attention to the details because they matter. Notice how dynamic the crew is especially on the gybes. On the transitions and gybes I want crews to start trimming through the block like in the video. On the tacks the crew rolls with both feet on one side, this is not how I personally roll. However if you consistently are not getting enough roll in light conditions roll with both feet on one side.  In the tacks they both trim in together while not closing the slot. This makes a big difference and you should work together on that.</p>
        <p class="bottomMargin">In the second video this shows more of the skippers movements in a tack. I will try to find some good gybe videos later. Notice that the main is trimmed all the way in entering the tack. However it is eased while the skippers switches sides. A lot of you stay too trimmed in through the duration of the tack. You want to have that big trim in at the end of the tack. Also remember when you flatten it shifts your apparent wind back so you need to be more eased. Again this is also true with the jib. Keep the boat flat as you enter the tack don’t heel to leeward but in light conditions scoot in a little before your roll so it stays flat until you want to rip it. That goes for the crew as well. Tack slowly with minimal tiller movement especially in light air(unless it’s absolutely dead and you need to just turn the boat). At practice see if you can do it without pushing the tiller over the thwart. In a gybe you can pretty much just use body weight to turn especially on wing on wing gybes so give that a go as well. If you are having difficulty crossing and getting out on the rail look at his feet placement throughout the tack and hand placement when he grabs the rail. You can adjust the play back speed to to see it done slowly.</p>

        <h3 class="topPadding bottomMargin">New Rules</h3>
        <p class="bottomMargin">Some new eligibility rules and a new national ISSA Eligibility Committee exist. Please see below.</p>
        <p class="bottomMargin"><b>ISSA Procedural Rule 1.2 Competitors</b></p>
        <ol class="leftMargin rulesList">
          <li>All competitors must be listed on the school’s roster in ISSA’s registration system, and only eligible competitors may be listed on these rosters.</li>
          <li>All competitors must be full-time students, in the 9th grade or higher, of the school they represent, and subject to the academic and disciplinary requirements of that school. A student is considered to be in his or her grade for the school year, including past graduation or advancement to the next level, until the new school year starts. </li>
          <li>No student-athlete shall compete for more than one school in any one ISSA Competition Season by transfer or any other method, except as specified in PR 4.2.</li>
          <li>Homeschooled and Remote Students</li>
          <ol class="leftMargin rulesSubList" type="a">
            <li>Homeschooled and remote students are defined as those who are not enrolled in classes at a traditional school.</li>
            <li>If permitted by state and/or local public school policies and laws, homeschooled or remote students may apply to the ISSA Eligibility Committee for consideration to be assigned to a school within their school district.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Students attending a school with no co-curriculars and a formal agreement allowing their students to participate in another school's interscholastic athletic program may apply to the ISSA Eligibility Committee for consideration to be assigned to a school within their school district.</li>
          <li>Teams (students) may not combine with teams (students) from another school to form a team.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="topMargin bottomMargin">If you know anyone who may be affected by the new rules 4 and/or 5 (including students who may have previously had District Director Approval as a Home School or Special Situation School Assignment) above, they will need to complete the application at the link below by September 1, 2024 (in order to be eligible for Fall 2024 Season). The ISSA Eligibility Committee will meet shortly after the deadline (or possibly before) and rule on their eligibility and/or school assignment. It should be noted that these situations are rare, and the rules are very strict to qualify for a Homeschool/Remote Student/Special Situation school assignment.</p>

        <h3 class="topPadding bottomMargin">Final PCISA Notes</h3>
        <p class="bottomMargin">Please get people signed up for the email list, review the website, circulate the new rules above, register your school, and if you are new, seek guidance from previous team admins, coaches, or other teams near you. After carefully reviewing everything and seeking help from locals, let us know if you still need help with something. The SoCal & NorCal Mtgs. are great places to ask questions, get answers, and discuss things if you can wait. Remember, there are lots of you (100+ Teams, 750+ Sailors, plus Parents, Admins, & Coaches) and only a few of us (PCISA Officials). 10 minutes with each team is over two days of time.</p>
        <p class="bottomMargin">Please be patient while we wait for our many partners (Yacht Clubs, Junior Program Directors, Volunteers, etc.) to finish up their summers. We should have most things fully up to speed by September 1st or shortly thereafter.</p>
        <p class="bottomMargin">Sail Fast and Enjoy!</p>

        <h3 class="topPadding bottomMargin">Tips & Tricks from Coach John Fretwel</h3>
        <ul class="leftMargin">
          <li>Results for all our events will always be posted at <a class="link" href="scores.hssailing.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scores.hssailing.org</a>.</li>
          <li>Each event opens to the Report summary by default. There you will see the current overall standings, with A and B division subtotals listed for each team. There's also an interesting graph at the bottom of the page that illustrates how teams progressed through the event.</li>
          <li>You can also click on the <b>Full Scores</b> tab, where you can see each individual race finish.</li>
          <li>Or you can click on <b>Division A</b> or <b>Division B</b>, to see the rankings for those divisions, individually; and also the names and class year of the sailors who sailed each race. Big thanks to Turgut Derman for registering our team, and for entering this "RP form" regatta participation information from my messaging, as the regatta progressed!</li>
          <li>You can also click <b>Sailors</b> for a look at every team's roster.</li>
          <li>Everyone should be familiar with the <b>Rotations</b> link, which tells us which boat our team is assigned to for each two-race set, which is obviously critical, and we did well with during racing this weekend.</li>
          <li>Boathandling should continue to be our most important focus until we are confident that our maneuvers are at least up to fleet par, and ideally tend to be a gain when they happen. Please check out this good video of <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/4BPMqAfYkek?si=RecTFYYNCJfXinAc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CFJ Roll Tacks from Tufts University</a> for some great examples.</li>
          <li>Note how far the skippers are staying forward between tacks, with knees together in an athletic semi-taught posture; to translate body motions well to the boat.</li>
          <li>Note how skippers always transfer the tiler extension to the new side and straighten the tiller, BEFORE moving their body across, so the tiller doesn't get stuck behind them, causing an over-turn.</li>
          <li>Note how crews are trimming the jib in on the new tack with ONE LONG PULL, by "punching the sky"</li>
          <li>Note how good tacks bring water way up on the boat's side deck or even into the cockpit, and the rudder comes nearly or completely out of the water! (Bring a bailer!)</li>
